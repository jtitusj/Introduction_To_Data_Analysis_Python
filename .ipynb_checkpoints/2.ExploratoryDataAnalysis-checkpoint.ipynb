    "### Why Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Data Analysis Library in Python. Some of its inspiration is taken from the programming language R which is another language that is widely used for data analysis. Now, while R excels in data analysis, it has a steeper learning curve which make it difficult for beginners to learn. Now some developers wanted to solve this issue and their solution was to develop a data analysis library in a language that is much easier to learn. Hence, Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "To load the pandas library into our notebooks, we do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we add the words `as pd`. When we do this, we are **aliasing**. That is, instead of typing `pandas`, we just need to type `pd` which is easier."
